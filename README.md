# Bank_Customer_Churn_Classification_By_Deep_Learning

The project's objective is to classify bank customers as potential churners or non-churners. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent a rigorous preprocessing phase, which encompassed data cleaning and scaling. Subsequently, the data was split into training and testing sets. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with default parameters was initially implemented, followed by prediction and evaluation. Notably, the evaluation demonstrated minimal deviation, indicating that the model was unlikely to be overfit. To further optimize performance, a Bayesian Optimization technique was employed for hyper-parameter tuning, resulting in the identification of the most effective parameters. Finally, the ANN model, configured with the optimized parameters, achieved an accuracy rate of 86%.
